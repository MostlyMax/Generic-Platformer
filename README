Welcome to a generic platformer! The idea behind this project is to have a platformer where adding new levels
is extremely simple.

Here is a guide to get started:

1. Go to: https://sketch.io/sketchpad/
2. Click on crop
3. Set width to 800, height to 600, make sure to click apply!
4. Draw! (itâ€™s the feather icon)
5. Tips: Try to set pixel size bigger than 3, draw using line tool, find a better drawing program, player always spawns
at (20,20) from top left
6. After saving, rename it level(#).png and add to res folder
